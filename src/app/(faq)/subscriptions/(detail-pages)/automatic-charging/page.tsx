        <h2>How our subscription works</h2>
        <p>
          If you have been charged, it means that you previously visited our website or one of the app stores and
          purchased a trial period or a subscription for our HD - Human Design App Premium plan. As you didn't cancel
          your subscription renewal, you were automatically charged for continued access to our Premium features.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            ‚ùóWe always recommend canceling your trial before the last day of your trial period to avoid a charge.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Our subscriptions renew automatically, unless canceled, to ensure a seamless experience during your Human
          Design journey.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Trial ends after 3 days, and further renewals happen weekly.</li>
          <li>
            If you started without trial, the subscription renewals happen quarterly or yearly on your subscription
            date.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We hope this clarifies why you were charged and sheds light on our subscription mechanism.</p>
